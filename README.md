# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the code attempts to parse a user ID as an integer without first verifying that the input is a valid number. This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior if the ID is not a number.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Bug

The primary issue lies in the lack of input validation. The route handler directly attempts to parse the `userId` as an integer using `parseInt()` without any checks to ensure it's a valid integer.  If the `userId` is not a number (e.g., a string or null), `parseInt()` will return `NaN`, and subsequent operations may fail or throw errors.

## Solution

The solution involves adding input validation to check if `userId` is a number before attempting to parse it. This prevents errors caused by invalid input.
